      Pairing active on your Three account to enable the cellular use of the watch. You can activate Smartwatch Pairing on your account by going through the pairing journey on your iPhone and Apple Watch.

     <h2>Additional information about Three Insurance</h2>
     <p>If added, Three Insurance will protect your Three device. There are two types of cover to choose from. Your chosen cover type is shown above and will be confirmed in your welcome pack, which will be sent to you shortly.</p>
     <p><b>Damage Cover:</b> covers Accidental Damage for your Mobile Phone or Connected Device and provides an extended warranty after the expiry of the manufacturer's warranty.</p>
     <p><b>Full Cover:</b> covers Loss, Theft & Accidental Damage for your Mobile Phone or Connected Device and provides an extended warranty after the expiry of the manufacturer's warranty.</p>
     <p>Cover starts at the same time as your new contract. For full terms, including how to complain, go to www.three.co.uk/insurance. Your monthly premium will appear on your Three account (shown on your Three bill under "other charges"). If you complete a claim you'll need to pay a claim excess fee. Your premium is shown in the table above, alongside your choice of Full or Damage Cover and you can find details of the claims excess fees in your Three Insurance welcome pack. If you change your mind you can cancel Three Insurance within 28 days and we'll refund your premium, provided you haven't made a claim. After that you can cancel at any time and cover will finish at the end of the paid period. Your cover will be cancelled if you cancel your Three contract or otherwise after 60 months. The Insurer is Starr International (Europe) Limited, which is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority ("PRA") and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") and the PRA. The administrator is SquareTrade Limited, which is authorised and regulated by the FCA (no. 538538) in the United Kingdom. Registered office: 5 Golden Square, London, W1F 9BS, United Kingdom.</p>
